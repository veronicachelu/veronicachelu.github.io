Despite the ubiquity of this technique, there is no consensus over the objective that the critic should optimize. Using an analogy with Q-learning, it is often taken to be a variation on the TD-error. Except in specific cases, for instance when using compatible function approximation, this objective is not directly linked to the quality of the resulting gradient estimate and a better critic does not necessarily translate to a better actor. Worse, few results exist when the network used for the critic has low capacity. Leveraging recent lower bounds on the expected return, we propose an extension leading to a new objective for the critic. In contrast with existing results, the resulting objective is directly linked to the expected return of the actor, regardless of the parameterization used for both the actor and the critic. Furthermore, that objective depends on the policy gradient method used. For example, why a method like REINFORCE will require the critic to be a good approximation of the Q-value, methods based on the stochastic value gradient will instead require the critic to be a good approximation of the derivative of the Q-value with respect to the action. Importantly, this approach provides performance guarantees as well as conditions on the critic to guarantee monotonic improvement of the actor in expectation. If these conditions are not met, which will happen when the critic network does not have enough capacity, a hybrid approach using both Monte-Carlo estimates of the return and a critic can be used, with weights provided by the theory. Although we focus on actor-critic methods, our approach can be extended to other approximations of the gradient, for instance based on a model of the environment.","tags":null,"title":"Actor-critic as a joint maximization problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Veronica Chelu","Diana Borsa","Doina Precup","Hado van Hasselt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"d77ae06802532e49ecf0972a7bbaaf84","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/2022-selective-credit-assignment/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-selective-credit-assignment/","section":"publication","summary":"Efficient credit assignment is essential for reinforcement learning algorithms in both prediction and control settings. We describe a unified view on temporal-difference algorithms for selective credit assignment. These selective algorithms apply weightings to quantify the contribution of learning updates. We present insights into applying weightings to value-based learning and planning algorithms, and describe their role in mediating the backward credit distribution in prediction and control.

When combined with function approximation, such as neural networks, this combination is known as the deadly triad and is potentially unstable. Recently, it has been shown that stability and good performance at scale can be achieved by combining emphatic weightings and multi-step updates. This approach, however, is generally limited to sampling complete trajectories in order, to compute the required emphatic weighting. In this paper we investigate how to combine emphatic weightings with non-sequential, off-line data sampled from a replay buffer. We develop a multi-step emphatic weighting that can be combined with replay, and a time-reversed n-step TD learning algorithm to learn the required emphatic weighting. We show that these state weightings reduce variance compared with prior approaches, while providing convergence guarantees. We tested the approach at scale on Atari 2600 video games, and observed that the new X-ETD(n) agent improved over baseline agents, highlighting both the scalability and broad applicability of our approach.","tags":null,"title":"Learning Expected Emphatic Traces for Deep RL","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Veronica Chelu","Doina Precup","Hado van Hasselt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"ecd9f98d6a91e3c92b9701991b2078b5","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/2020-neurips-forethought-and-hindsight-in-credit-assignment/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-neurips-forethought-and-hindsight-in-credit-assignment/","section":"publication","summary":"We address the problem of credit assignment in reinforcement learning and explore fundamental questions regarding the way in which an agent can best use additional computation to propagate new information, by planning with internal models of the world to improve its predictions.

The contributions of this paper are as follows: we present a new end-to-end solution for delimiting the safe drivable area for each frame by means of identifying the closest obstacle in each direction from the driving vehicle, we use this approach to calculate the distance to the nearest obstacles and we incorporate it into a unified end-to-end architecture capable of joint object detection, curb detection and safe drivable area detection. Furthermore, we describe the family of networks for both a high accuracy solution and a low complexity solution.
